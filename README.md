# FighterAPI

This is a simple RESTful API created using Express chained Routing. It is used to execute GET POST PUT PATCH DELETE requests to data stores in my local MongoDB database.
The data consists of small snippets on the fighter jets operated by fighter jets . Though this can be use to access any kind of articles .
